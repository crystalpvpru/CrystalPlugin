# CrystalPlugin
Main crystalpvp.ru plugin

Requires ProtocolLib, Paper, DeathMessagesPrime and DuelsAPI jars to be included as libraries

Was made in the end of 2020. Features some bad code.

Some things don't work at all (anti vine growth, anti portal spawning), some are easily bypassable (anti packet fly), others are just plain shit (look at Utils.java)

I wouldn't recommmend using this without any modification.
